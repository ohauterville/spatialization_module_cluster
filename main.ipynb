Indeed, we observe that at the country scale, as time passes, the GDP/cap increases and some observables as the number of cars or as the number of m2/cap. This means that the quality of life, and thus the stocks consumed by a region improve. But this exponential growth does not increase indefinetely. A saturation is observed even if the GDP/cap still increase. This is explained because people usually do not own 2 or 3 cars even though they possess the money to. An logistic function, also known as the S curve, is a way to model this observation.\n",
